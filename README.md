# How to C and C++

Welcome to the **How to C and C++** repository. This project is a personal learning journey to explore and master the fundamentals of C and C++. It is also designed to serve as a resource for others (you reading this) who want to learn these powerful programming languages too.

## Topics Covered

- Basics of C and C++ (syntax, variables, data types)
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Pointers and memory management
- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O and more!

## Cloning the repository

## How to run files (for Linux/MacOs)

1. Compile file with
```c
gcc file.c -o file
```
or for c++

```cpp
g++ file.cpp -o file
```

2. Run file by using
```cpp
./file
```

If you are on Windows, just add .exe for compile

g++ file.cpp -o file.exe
/* run the file with */
file.exe
```
